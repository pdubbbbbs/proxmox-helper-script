# Contributing to Proxmox Helper Script

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Proxmox Helper Script as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PowerShell best practices
- Use proper cmdlet naming conventions (Verb-Noun)
- Include comment-based help for functions
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include proper error handling
- Add logging where appropriate

## Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass locally before submitting PR
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where applicable
- Test across different PowerShell versions (7.0+)
- Test on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Documentation
- Update README.md with details of changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md following the established format
- Add/update example code when needed
- Include inline documentation for complex code
- Update Quick Start guide if needed

## Pull Request Process
1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of the maintainers

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that is a concern.

## Report bugs using Github Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/pdubbbbbs/proxmox-helper-script/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that did not work)
